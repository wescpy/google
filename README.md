# Google

This repo contains developer code samples from the `Coding #Python and #Google with @wescpy` [blog posts](https://dev.to/wescpy) as well as older but still relevant content such as posts from my posts on [the old G Suite blog](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2015/) as well as my [old Python and Google API blog](https://wescpy.blogspot.com/).

Single product samples will follow a product tree hierarchy, e.g., `GWS/drive`, `GCP/appengine`, etc., while cross-product samples will go into `multi` with product-based folder names, e.g., `apps-script-bigquery-sheets-slides`. Content will be indexed in a table below as they become available.
