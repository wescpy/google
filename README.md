# Google developer code samples

## Introduction

This repo contains developer code samples from the [posts in my `Coding #Python and #Google with @wescpy` blog](https://dev.to/wescpy) as well as older but still relevant content such as my posts from [the old G Suite blog](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2015/) as well as my [old Python and Google API blog](https://wescpy.blogspot.com/).

## Content structure

Samples demonstrating only one product group are prefixed under the product name, e.g., `GCP` == Google Cloud (Platform), `GWS` == Google Workspace, etc., hierarchically followed by the specific product, e.g., `GWS/drive`, `GCP/appengine`, etc., while cross-product samples will go into `multi` with product-based folder names, e.g., `apps-script-bigquery-sheets-slides`. Content and relevant APIs/platforms will be indexed in a table (coming soon) as they become available.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Updates and fixes to existing samples belonging to posts or Google documentation will be integrated directly. If you feel inclined to provide additional examples of API usage, I'll add those to a `community` folder under your GH username. Currently, only Python and JavaScript (Node.js, Apps Script) samples are being considered. To be considered for publishing a code sample, file a bug indicating why you want to submit your sample, what APIs it uses, and how it benefits users. Once I accept it, you can submit a PR against that issue.
