# Node.js App Engine
## "Hello World!" sample app

This is the GAE "Hello World!" sample app for Node.js developers; there is another [folder for Python developers](/cloud/appengine/python3). It's featured in a [GAE intro post](https://dev.to/wescpy/hosting-apps-in-the-cloud-with-google-app-engine-3fn).


## Prerequisites

- A Google account and Cloud (GCP) project with an active billing account
- Familiarity with operating system terminal/shell commands
- General skills in Node.js/JavaScript, `npm`, a web framework like Express.js, etc.
- [Currently supported versions of Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/lifecycle/support-schedule#nodejs)


### Table of contents

If there is a logical codelab to do immediately after completing one, they will be designated as NEXT. Other recommended codelabs will be listed as RECOMMENDED, and the more optional ones will be labeled as OTHERS (and usually in some kind of priority order).


## Community

Python App Engine developers hang out in various online communities, including these:
- [Slack](https://googlecloud-community.slack.com) (`#app-engine`, `#python`, and other channels); visit [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/googlecloud-community/shared_invite/zt-ywj8ieuc-BrAaHC~qe5IgelXS9vzNRA) to join
- [Reddit](http://reddit.com) in the [Google Cloud](https://reddit.com/googlecloud) or [App Engine](https://reddit.com/appengine) subs (subReddits).
