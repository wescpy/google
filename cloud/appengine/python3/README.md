# Python App Engine
## "Hello World!" sample app

This is the GAE "Hello World!" sample app for Python developers; there is another [folder for Node.js developers](/cloud/appengine/nodejs). It's featured in a [GAE intro post](https://dev.to/wescpy/hosting-apps-in-the-cloud-with-google-app-engine-3fn).


## Prerequisites

- A Google account and Cloud (GCP) project with an active billing account
- Familiarity with operating system terminal/shell commands
- General skills in Python 3.x and a web framework like Flask, etc.
- [Currently supported versions of Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/lifecycle/support-schedule#python)


### Table of contents

If there is a logical codelab to do immediately after completing one, they will be designated as NEXT. Other recommended codelabs will be listed as RECOMMENDED, and the more optional ones will be labeled as OTHERS (and usually in some kind of priority order).
